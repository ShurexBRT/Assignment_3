        <h3>Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March
            1935),<br>
            also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist.</h3>

        <p>Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
            long-distance
            telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire)

            at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization").

            Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which
            later
            became NASA.</p>
